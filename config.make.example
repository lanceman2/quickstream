# This file defines possible make "configuration" variables.
#
# This make file is used when building/installing using the quickbuild
# build system to build/install quickstream.   This file is ignored when
# building/installing quickbuild with the GNU autotools build system, and
# when building/installing with meson (TODO).
#
# We try to keep similar make variables in the GNU autotools build method.
#
# The optionally built files are automatically added based on running
# programs like 'pkg-config' in the quickbuild makefiles (Makefile) to see
# if dependences are available.


# We really want there to be very little to configure in this file.
# PREFIX is (or will be) a directory that contains all the files
# that are installed for this software project.

PREFIX = /usr/local/encap/quickstream


# Set CPPFLAGS for debug build options:
#
#
# SPEW_LEVEL_* controls macros in lib/debug.h
#
# The following may be defined; defining them turns on the following CPP
# macro functions that are in debug.h which is a source file for
# libquickstream.so and other binary files.
#
# CPP macro flag         makes SPEW CPP marco functions
